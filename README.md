# Military Social Network Analysis

### Purpose

**This site is a way to visualize the relationships between various military-affiliated Facebook pages.**

I scraped the data from Facebook using Netvizz and did the graph analysis (creating communities in the data, etc.) and visualization in Gephy.

Head to https://samgoodgame.github.io/network_analysis/ to check it out.
